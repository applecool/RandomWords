This is a reference file for my database structure.

DB has only a single table called 'wordstable' with three columns "serial_no","words" and "count".

The serial_no is an integer field with an auto increment attribute. It is the primary key.
The words is an varchar field with max length of 55 characters.
The count is an integer field.
